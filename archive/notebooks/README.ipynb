    "By now, the company has acumulated about 127000 new clients and the business team wants to offer the vehicle insurance to this new clients. The problem is that the campaign will be made in the shortest period possible and the capacity of calls of the marketing team is limited to 20000 call during the period of the campaing.\n",
